– Mark Sanford lost to Katie Arrington in South Carolina's GOP primary for governor on Tuesday, and President Trump tweeted his support for her hours after the race. Sanford has been a vocal critic of Trump's policies, and the president's endorsement of Arrington's opponent was a key factor in his defeat, the New York Times reports. The president tweeted that Sanford should be "fired" if he didn't "get out of the way" and that he should "stop attacking the President and his policies on everything from immigration to the Supreme Court."

– President-elect Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Wednesday, declaring that “democracy has prevailed” and summoning American resilience and unity to confront the deeply divided nation’s historic confluence of crises. Biden took the oath at a US Capitol that had been battered by an insurrectionist siege just two weeks earlier. On a cold Washington morning dotted with snow flurries, the quadrennial ceremony unfolded within a circle of security forces evocative of a war zone and devoid of crowds because of the coronavirus pandemic. Outgoing President Donald Trump, who has not formally conceded to Mr Biden, is not attending the ceremony.
– Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are stepping down as CEO and president of the company they co-founded 21 years ago, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai has been promoted to the top job at parent company Alphabet, reports the Wall Street Journal. "While it has been a tremendous privilege to be deeply involved in the day-to-day management of Google for so long, we believe it's time to assume the role of proud parents—offering advice and love, but not daily nagging," the pair wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. "We believe it
– A new coronavirus outbreak is sweeping the world, and scientists are working around the world to develop a vaccine to combat it. "I think there’s a high chance that it will work based on other things that we have done with this type of vaccine,” says Sarah Gilbert, a professor of virology at Oxford University. “It's not just a hunch and as every week goes by we have more data to look at. I would go for 80%, that's my personal view.” But the creation of a working vaccine that can be safely distributed to a broad population requires a tremendous amount of rigor and caution, so the process is likely to take at least a year.
– Justin Amash is running for president as a Libertarian. The Michigan congressman announced Tuesday that he has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, reports the Detroit Free Press.

– It's deadline day for the IRS to turn over President Trump's tax returns to House Democrats, but President Trump says he won't do it. "I would love to give them, but I'm not going to do it while I'm under audit," Trump told reporters as he left the White House for a trip to Texas on Wednesday. House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, had asked for Trump's personal and business tax returns for six years, including information on eight of the President's business entities, reports the Hill.

– The House is set to vote this week on a bill that would create a select committee to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. The bill, introduced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Monday, would establish a committee with subpoena power and 13 members, reports the Hill. It would have the power to appoint the chair and five members—five of them "after consultation with the minority leader,” a reference to Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who is expected to be the committee's chair. Pelosi says she's "seriously considering" appointing a Republican to the committee, which would give Democrats more power than they would have had in the failed bipartisan panel, reports Politico.
– The Libertarian Party's candidate for governor of Indiana, Donald Rainwater, has racked up some unprecedented polling numbers for a Libertarian in a race in which both major parties are running candidates. The 57-year-old Navy veteran and information technology professional hit as high as 24% in a Change Research poll back in September. While that very high result was an outlier, Rainwater has in the past week polled at 14% (in a Ragnar Research Partners poll) and 15%

– The House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on two immigration bills that would provide a path to citizenship for millions living illegally in the United States.

"All the fundamentals are pointing to a Democratic tsunami rumbling offshore, even if we're being too careful about

Officials also said the next step impacting Iran’s compliance with the deal would be taken in 60 days. They did not elaborate. Iran has warned it would step up nuclear activities in a bid to raise the pressure on Europe, China, and Russia to provide relief from crippling US economic sanctions and to raise costs to Washington of continuing its maximum-pressure campaign.
– The Senate on Saturday voted 57-43 to acquit former President Donald Trump on an impeachment charge of inciting an insurrection, reports the Washington Post. Seven Republicans joined Democrats in a vote that fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict Trump in the Senate. The House last month passed a single article of impeachment against him for his role in encouraging his supporters to amass at the US Capitol on Jan. 6. The acquittal comes more than a month after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol as lawmakers were counting the electoral results that certified Trump's loss. Five people died in the riot, including a police officer.
– The Biden administration will ask US attorneys appointed by President Trump to resign from their posts, but the prosecutor overseeing the tax probe tied to Hunter Biden, the president's son, will remain in place, a senior Justice Department official tells Fox News. Acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson plans to ask holdover US Attorney David Weiss, who runs the office in Delaware, to resign, officials familiar with the matter say. It is standard procedure for new presidents to ask for the resignation of all US attorneys once they enter the office, but Weiss is exempt from that rule.
– New York has ordered a statewide lockdown amid the worsening coronavirus pandemic that will shut down most of the Empire State—including New York City.

People from those countries will still be able to visit the US as tourists. In 2018 the US
– President Trump has called for an "angry majority" of GOP voters, a nod to Richard Nixon's "silent majority" and Ronald Reagan's "moral majority" to send a powerful message to Democrats heading into the 2020 election season, NBC News reports. With 62% of precincts reporting, Republican Gov. Matt Bevin was leading Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear, 49.4% to 48.5% in the Kentucky governor's race, with more than half of the vote counted, NBC reports. Bevin is expected to be re-elected in November, but the race is too close to call, NBC notes.

– Jon Ossoff has won a runoff in Georgia's special election for the US Senate, giving the Democrats a slim majority in the upper chamber of Congress for the first time in a decade, NBC News projects. The 33-year-old Democrat defeated Republican David Perdue in Tuesday's runoff, which was a rematch of the November election that failed to give either candidate a majority, forcing a runoff election. NBC's projection came as rioters backing President Trump stormed the Capitol building after he urged supporters at a rally to march to Congress. The attack on the legislature delayed the formal Electoral College count, which dozens of Republicans challenged at Trump’s

– Adam Schiff's closing arguments in the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump are getting a lot of attention, and it's not because he's making a good case for impeachment, but because the president's allies are using him as an example. The New York Times' Jonathan Adler points out that the media loves Schiff, and that's because it's the same media that has spent years passing along every falsehood and selective leak the California congressman gave them to fuel the Russia-collusion hysteria. "The same people who still accept his allegations—knowing his long history of fabrications—without much skepticism, spent yesterday pretending that Schiff was a modern-day Cicero. All of it was about believable as Schiff’s
