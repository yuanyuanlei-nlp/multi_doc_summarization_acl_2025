– Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee say the NRA was a "foreign asset" for Russia as the 2016 presidential election neared, Politico reports. According to a report released Friday, the NRA and its officers, board members, and donors "engaged in a years-long effort to facilitate the US-based activities of Maria Butina and Alexander Torshin," despite being aware of the two Russian nationals' ties to the Kremlin. Butina is a Russian spy convicted of spying for the US; Torshin is a top official in the Russian government who has ties to President Vladimir Putin. The report states the NRA "underwrote political access for convicted spy Maria Butina and others despite knowing their Kremlin ties." "NRA officers' apparent use of the NRA for personal gain fits a larger pattern of reported self-dealing and raises serious questions about whether the NRA broke US tax laws," Sen. Ron Wyden, the committee's ranking Democrat, said in a tweet. The report states the NRA and its donors spent tens of thousands of dollars in an effort to " facilitate the US-based activities of Maria Butina and Alexander Torshin," despite being aware of their ties to the Kremlin.

Richard Spencer says he was traveling to Sweden this week to address white nationalists when he was stopped by authorities, NBC News reports.

– The Department of Education will forgive $150 million in federal student loan debt for 15,000 borrowers who were defrauded by for-profit colleges, Secretary Betsy DeVos announced Thursday. The Wall Street Journal reports the department had been fighting a judge's order that would have forced it to forgive debt for students who attended for-profit colleges that closed after students borrowed money from the schools. The department says it will forgive the debt even though it lost a legal fight against the Obama administration's policy of penalizing for-profit colleges that lied to students about their ability to repay their loans. The Justice Department had argued the policy was unconstitutional.
– President Trump on Friday blocked the release of a classified Democratic rebuttal to the memo he allowed to be made public last week, the Washington Post reports. According to the Hill, the classified rebuttal to the GOP memo written by Rep. Adam Schiff and Rep. Jerrold Nadler details alleged surveillance abuses by the FBI and Justice Department in the early stages of the investigation into Russian election interference and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The rebuttal was written in response to the memo written by Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah that accused the FBI and Justice Department of malfeasance in their investigation of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page. Trump allowed the release of that memo last week, but on Friday he blocked the release of the Democratic rebuttal because of national security concerns.

Macron is hosting a two-day climate summit Tuesday and Wednesday.
– The man who opened fire in a Texas church yesterday, killing two people before he was fatally shot by congregants, had "something not right" about him, a witness tells the New York Times. She says he made her feel uncomfortable when he sat feet away from her in the sanctuary of the West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement. The church's pastor says the gunman was "acting suspiciously" before the shooting and drew the attention of the church's security team.

– Twitter says it has permanently banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his Infowars show for "abusive behavior," the AP reports. The move comes a day after Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said the company was considering banning Jones over "hateful behavior." In a video that went viral, Jones can be heard shouting at a CNN reporter who asked him about the Sandy Hook school shooting, which he has called a hoax. The video has since been removed from YouTube. Jones, who has hosted his own radio show on Infowars, can be heard in the video calling the reporter a liar and a liar-in-chief, among other things. Twitter said in a statement that Jones and his show "violated our community guidelines because they engaged in abusive behavior, including posting content that was in direct violation of these guidelines." The company did not mention the video in its statement.
– The Supreme Court on Monday left in place a Kentucky law requiring doctors to perform ultrasounds and show fetal images to patients before abortions. The justices did not comment in refusing to review an appeals court ruling that upheld the law.

The law, which had been blocked by lower courts since 2017, will now take effect.
– House Democrats will introduce two articles of impeachment against President Trump, they announced Tuesday. One of the articles is for "abuse of power" related to Trump's actions in Ukraine, while the other is for "obstruction of Congress," the Washington Post reports. The articles of impeachment will be introduced in the House Judiciary Committee and are not based on Robert Mueller's report, which some had hoped would lead to impeachment based on that report, the Hill reports. "The framers of the Constitution prescribed a clear remedy for presidents who so violate their oath of office," said committee chair Jerry Nadler. Nadler said the articles will be introduced "in the service to our duty to the Constitution and to our country," CNN reports.

– A "bombshell" report out of New York says Gov. Andrew Cuomo's aides tried to hide the true number of nursing-home deaths from the public by altering a state report, the Wall Street Journal reports. According to the New York Times, aides to the governor were "alarmed" when state health officials released a report in June with a count of nursing-home deaths related to the coronavirus. They wanted to keep the number under wraps, so the report was altered to include a count of all nursing-home residents who died, not just those who were transferred to the hospital after becoming sick. The July report focused only on nursing-home deaths, and didn't include those who were transferred to the hospital after becoming sick.
– The number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 12,000 in the week ending Aug. 15, putting the total at 1.11 million, the Wall Street Journal reports. Economists had expected 910,000 new claims. The number of people applying for unemployment benefits has been above the 1 million mark for three of the past four weeks. The Journal sees the unexpected increase in jobless claims as "a red flag about the stability of small business in the United States." The unexpected jump in jobless numbers to more than 1 million is a red flag about the stability of small business in the United States. The first week of claims data after the Paycheck Protection Program stopped accepting applications shows the need for renewed stimulus for small businesses and consumers, advocates, and business owners say. "We've had to lay off and furlough," one business owner tells the Journal. "We need a stimulus."

– British Prime Minister Theresa May's plan to forge a Brexit deal with the European Union appears to be all but dead after four of her senior ministers quit her Cabinet on Sunday. Brexit secretary Dominic Raab was the latest to step down, leaving May with little choice but to seek the approval of Parliament for the deal that would see the UK remain in the EU customs union after Brexit, reports the BBC. Defeat of the deal could set up a leadership crisis in May's Conservative Party, with pro-Brexit and pro-EU members fearing that the agreement would leave the UK tied too closely to the EU for years to come, reports the Guardian.
– "I'm feeling great," President Trump said to cheers from a White House crowd Saturday, his first public appearance since being hospitalized with the deadly virus known as coronavirus. The president, who didn't wear a mask during his 20-minute speech on the White House lawn, appeared to be in better health than he had been in taped videos earlier in the week, the Washington Post reports. His doctor, Dr. Sean Conley, said Saturday night that a sample from the president's blood showed no sign of the virus. "This evening I am happy to report that in addition to the President meeting the CDC criteria for the safe discontinuation of isolation, this morning's COVID PCR sample demonstrates, by currently recognized standards, he is no longer considered a transmission risk to others," Conley wrote in a memo released by the White House.
– A big development in the Robert Mueller investigation: The special counsel has impaneled a grand jury in Washington, DC, to investigate whether President Trump obstructed justice, reports the Wall Street Journal. It's a "major signal that the probe into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia is getting a whole lot bigger," writes Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post. It's also a "sign that his inquiry is growing in intensity." Here's what else you need to know about the grand jury and the investigation: The big question is whether the impaneling of a grand jury means Mueller's investigation is "growing in scope and seriousness," writes Cillizza at the Post. He explains why that's the case in this video.
– It was a brutal day on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,861 points, or 6.9%, to close at 25,128. The S&P 500 slid 5.9%, and the Nasdaq fell 5.3%. It was the worst single-day decline for the three major averages since March 16, when they all fell more than 11% as it became clear that the coronavirus would have dramatic effects on everyday life, CNBC reports. Tech stocks were especially hard hit, with the five most valuable falling more than 5%. Microsoft was the biggest loser, shedding more than $80 billion in value, while Facebook was down more than 5%. Nearly every other tech stock was down as well, with Cisco (-7.91%) and IBM (-9.1%) seeing particularly steep drops.
– US employers ramped up hiring in November, adding 266,000 jobs—more than economists had expected—and the unemployment rate dropped to a half-century low of 3.5%, the Wall Street Journal reports. Economists had expected a gain of 180,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate had fallen from 3.6% in October to 3.5%, the Labor Department said Friday. The rate has now fallen to a level that's only been reached three times since the 1970s. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2%, with a year-over-year gain of 3.1%. The stronger pace of hiring could help juice up the broader US economy, which is still expanding but at a slower pace than last year. "The stronger pace of hiring could help juice up the broader US economy, which is still expanding but at a slower pace than last year," the Journal's Steven Russolillo writes. "The healthy job gain runs against a widespread view that businesses are struggling to find workers with unemployment so low."
– House Democratic leaders have postponed a vote on Joe Biden’s $1 trillion infrastructure bill until tomorrow to give themselves more time to hammer out a larger climate change and social safety net bill, the New York Times reports. The delay came after progressive Democrats refused to support the bill until Congress acts on a reconciliation package projected to cost $3.5 trillion. Pelosi had promised centrist Democrats she would bring the Senate-passed measure to the floor today, and spent hours negotiating with members in order to fulfill her pledge. The infrastructure vote was rescheduled for Friday, giving them more time to reach agreement on an expansive climate change and social safety net bill that would bring liberals along. Why it matters: Pelosi had promised centrist Democrats she would bring the Senate-passed measure to the floor today, and spent hours negotiating with members in order to fulfill her pledge. House Democratic leaders and supporters of the bill insisted the postponement was only a temporary setback.

The Washington Post reports that the charges were the result of Mueller's wide-ranging investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, as well as possible obstruction of justice by Trump.
– The number of people caught trying to cross the US-Mexico border illegally in February was the highest since 2006, sources tell the Washington Times. US border agents detained nearly 100,000 migrants in February, the highest arrest total for the month of February since 2006. More than 50,000 people were caught in February alone, the sources say. The spike in arrests comes as the Obama administration struggles to deal with an influx of immigrant children being brought to the US by their parents. "Quite frankly, we are working as hard as we are, not only in addressing the urgency of the challenge, but also in building the capacity to manage it," Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters at the White House on Monday. He said the influx is a "stressful challenge," but not a "crisis," the Los Angeles Times reports.
– "It's long past time to get rid of no-knock warrants," Sen. Rand Paul says. The Kentucky Republican introduced the Justice for Breonna Taylor Act on Thursday, which would prohibit federal law enforcement from carrying out a warrant "until after the officer provides notice of his or her authority and purpose," NBC News reports. The warrant—the type that led to the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor, an unarmed black woman, by a white police officer in 2014—has come under increasing scrutiny since her death. "I've come to the conclusion that it's long past time to get rid of no-knock warrants," Paul says in a statement. "This bill will effectively end no-knock raids in the United States." The Washington Post reports that the Justice Department is currently reviewing the use of no-knock warrants, which are used by federal, state, and local law enforcement.
– The Supreme Court ruled Monday that college football and men's and women's basketball players are employees of their schools and can be paid under federal law. In a 9-0 decision, the court sided with current and former athletes who sued the NCAA, saying the organization's restrictions on education benefits violate antitrust laws, the New York Times reports. The ruling says the NCAA can't stop schools from paying football and men's and women's basketball players, but it can't stop them from receiving benefits such as free laptops and paid internships. The decision "represents a landmark victory for college players and a significant moment in the history of college athletics, as lawmakers in Congress and statehouses weigh new laws to allow athletes to profit from personal endorsements and sponsorships," the NCAA said in a statement. The plaintiffs argued that the restrictions on education benefits violate the National Collegiate Athletic Association's constitutional rights to freedom of speech and association, as well as federal anti-trust laws, USA Today reports. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the court's opinion, which was upheld by a lower court.
– The Supreme Court ruled unanimously today that people convicted of low-level drug offenses can't be forced to pay huge fines—even if they haven't been convicted of a high-level drug offense. In Timbs v. Indiana, the court said that the state's ban on excessive fines violates the Constitution's equal protection clause, the AP reports. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the majority, said that "a person convicted of a low-level drug offense, even if he has not been convicted of a high-level drug offense, may be subject to excessive fines and penalties even if he has not been convicted of a high-level drug offense." The court's ruling "marks a watershed moment in the fight against excessive fines and other penalties for low-level drug offenses," writes Lyle Denniston at SCOTUSblog. It's the first time the high court has ruled that such penalties violate the Constitution's equal protection clause, he writes. The ruling could have a big impact on drug cases around the country, the New York Times notes, because it could make it harder for prosecutors to go after repeat offenders.
– The White House is seeking $250 billion in payments to Americans starting April 6, followed by another $250 billion cash payment round beginning May 18, according to the working draft of the plan obtained by Fox Business Network. President Trump's $1 trillion stimulus package is a gamble for reelection—and a sea change for Republicans once opposed to bailouts. The novel coronavirus is redefining Donald Trump's presidency eight months before he stands for reelection as he wagers that the potentially largest rescue package in US history could protect the American people from the economic carnage brought by the pandemic. The White House is moving forward with a proposed $1 trillion coronavirus package that would infuse Americans' bank accounts with two rounds of direct cash payments.
– Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said Monday that the Robert Mueller investigation is "close to being completed," the AP reports.

Sinema, meanwhile, is the first Democratic senator from Arizona in 30 years.
– President Trump is expected to formally announce Tuesday that he's ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but he'll do so with a six-month delay to give Congress time to come up with a legislative alternative, reports the New York Times. The Obama administration created the program to protect young immigrants brought to the US illegally as children by their parents from deportation, but the White House has been debating whether to end it. The delay will give lawmakers time to come up with a legislative alternative, reports the Washington Post.
– Gary Cohn, one of President Trump's top economic advisers, says he has drafted a resignation letter in the wake of Trump's controversial response to Charlottesville. In an interview with the Financial Times published Friday, Cohn said he was "disappointed" in Trump's initial response to the violence and that the president "can and must do better" in condemning white supremacists. "There is no excuse for this kind of violence, this kind of neo-Nazis, white supremacists, KKK members, whatever you want to call them," Cohn said. "These are evil people, and the president of the United States has to do a better job of condemning them." Cohn, who is Jewish, said he has no intention of stepping down from the Trump administration, the Hill reports. "I will continue to serve the president of the United States in my role as chief economic adviser," he said. "There is no reason for me to resign except to do what is best for the American people." In the Financial Times interview, Cohn said neo-Nazis and white supremacists won't "cause this Jew to leave his job."
– The House Intelligence Committee has been ordered to review former FBI chief James Comey's memos on his interactions with President Trump before they're released to the public, reports the Hill. The move comes after the committee's Republican chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, said he didn't see a need to release the memos because they don't show "any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia." Democrats, however, say the release is a violation of the Freedom of Information Act and are calling for the committee to review the memos before releasing them to the public. The New York Times, which first reported the release of Comey's memos, has a list of the president's alleged conversations with the former FBI chief.
– A manhunt is underway for a 23-year-old Tunisian man believed to have been the driver of the truck that plowed into a Berlin Christmas market on Monday, killing 12 and injuring 48.

Police say they found his identity papers inside the truck, which was rented by a company based in Pakistan, and are seeking him as a "person of interest." The suspect's name has not been released. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has described the attack as a "terrorist attack" and said the country was taking the case very seriously.
– President Trump says he's canceling his planned military parade because of the "ridiculously high" price tag. The Washington Post reports that the price tag for Trump's parade had jumped from $12 million to $92 million just two days after the midterm elections. Pentagon estimates for the parade, which had been planned for Veterans Day on Nov. 11, now stand at $92 million, according to the Hill. The president says he decided to cancel the parade because of the "ridiculously high" price tag. "Sadly, the Department of Veteran Affairs wanted to push back the parade so we can give our troops and their families a break," Trump said in a statement. "This will give our troops and their families a chance to celebrate independence and give our parade participants and the American people a chance to show their patriotism."

– "This is a game-changer," President Trump said Monday, announcing that the federal government is sending 150 million point-of-care tests for coronavirus to states as a "game-changer" that will allow them to reopen schools and protect first responders, the Washington Post reports. Trump had already announced that the government would be sending the tests in August before accepting the Republican National Convention. The tests are designed to spot coronavirus before it can spread from person to person. Trump said governors are being encouraged to use the tests at schools and other high-risk settings.
– Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has introduced a pair of bills that she says are designed to fire the nation's top infectious disease official and bar businesses from refusing service to people who are unvaccinated. The first, the "Fire Anthony Fauci Act," would fire President Joe Biden's chief scientist and make his salary $0, Mediaite reports. The second, the "We Will Not Comply Act," would ban so-called "Vaccine Passports," which require people to show they've been vaccinated or recently tested negative for a virus. The bills are "the latest stunt Greene has pulled since she was stripped of her committee assignments in February," notes the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. "It appears that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene will go to any length to get attention. And against our better judgment, in this instance, who are we to deny her?"
– Sen. Cory Gardner and Sen. Elizabeth Warren introduced a bipartisan bill Thursday that would allow states to regulate marijuana without the threat of federal interference, the Hill reports.

The bill would also allow states to decriminalize marijuana and allow marijuana businesses "out of the shadows," according to NBC News.
– President Trump's nominee for attorney general was confirmed by the Senate on Thursday, the AP reports. William Barr, a Republican lawyer who served in the Justice Department under George W. Bush, was confirmed by a 52-48 vote, with Democrats abstaining from voting. Barr replaces Jeff Sessions, who was pushed out after clashing with Trump over the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Russian election interference and possible ties between Trump's campaign and Russia. Barr replaces Jeff Sessions, who was pushed out after clashing with Trump over the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Russian election interference and possible ties between Trump's campaign and Russia. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the vote a "great day for the Department of Justice, the Senate, and the American people," the Washington Post reports. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he was "disappointed" by the confirmation of Barr, who has defended Trump in the past in regard to the Mueller investigation. "Mr. Barr's record of public service, including service as attorney general of the United States, makes him uniquely qualified to lead the Department of Justice at a time when the department and the country are facing unprecedented threats and challenges," Schumer said in a statement.
– More than 23 million people in Southern California are preparing for "the harshest lockdowns in the United States" as coronavirus cases spiked to record levels in the country's most populous state. The restrictions in California, ordered by Gov. Gavin Newsom, will take effect on a region-by-region basis as hospital intensive care unit beds are filled almost to capacity, call for bars, hair and nail salons, and tattoo shops to close again, the Epoch Times reports. Some 84% of the state's population will be subject to the new order, which will restrict movements and business. The restrictions in California, ordered by Gov. Gavin Newsom, will take effect on a region-by-region basis as hospital intensive care unit beds are filled almost to capacity, call for bars, hair and nail salons, and tattoo shops to close again. Some 33 million Californians will be subject to the new order, representing 84% of the state's population. The state mandated the restrictions in the Southland and Central Valley as capacity at hospitals' intensive care units hit dangerously low levels. The Los Angeles Times reports that Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes announced that deputies would not enforce the regional stay-at-home order that was scheduled to go into effect Dec. 6 throughout Southern California. "Compliance with health orders is a matter of personal responsibility and not a matter of law enforcement," Barnes said in a Dec. 5 news release.
– It was a big night for Democrats, who scored a net gain of at least 30 seats in the House and will have control of the chamber for the first time in more than a decade. Here's what you need to know: The math: Democrats need to gain 23 seats to take control, and the New York Times expects that to be closer to 25. The GOP still has an advantage in the Senate, but the big question is whether the Democrats will be able to use their new clout to force Trump into investigations into his campaign's ties to Russia, his businesses' possible tax evasion, and his actions during the first two years of his presidency, including his firing of FBI chief James Comey.
– Bernie Sanders has been declared the winner of New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary—but it was a nail-biter. Fox News called the race for the 78-year-old Vermont senator about a half-hour after the polls closed, with Pete Buttigieg second and Amy Klobuchar third. "Thank you, New Hampshire," Sanders told supporters. "Let me take this opportunity to thank the people of New Hampshire for a great victory tonight." Buttigieg, the 37-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Ind., who was vying to become the state's first openly gay governor, said his second-place finish was a sign his campaign is "here to stay," the AP reports. Klobuchar, a senator from Minnesota, had been surging in the polls and was widely expected to finish higher than Sanders. She told supporters Tuesday night that they had sent a "very clear message" to the Trump administration, the Washington Post reports. "The voters have sent a message to the White House," she said. "They want a president who is going to bring us together."
– President Trump appeared on Laura Ingraham's Fox News show Monday and defended his supporters against accusations from Joe Biden that they're an "armed militia" in the US.

The US, along with the UK and France, hit a Syrian air base with dozens of cruise missiles Saturday night in response to what Trump called a "barbaric" chemical attack. In a second tweet Sunday, Trump slammed Iran for supporting "Animal Assad," the AP reports. "Iran, Russia and Assad must be stopped!" he tweeted. "They are supporting an animal Assad who kills his own people and enjoys it!"
– Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, testified Friday on Capitol Hill as part of the House Intelligence Committee's effort to impeach President Trump, and she didn't shy away from talking about her time in the White House. But one line in particular caught the attention of the president himself. "Why is Marie Yovanovitch weak and why is she weak?" Trump tweeted. Yovanovitch, 61, served in the George W. Bush administration and was ambassador to Ukraine from 2009 to 2016. She was forced out of her post after it was revealed she was having an affair with the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, reports the Washington Post. Yovanovitch told the committee that Kushner's father-in-law, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, once called her and said, "I'm going to kill you." Yovanovitch said she told him she was going to testify against him, but he didn't listen. She said she was then " hounded out of the job" by Trump associates. The president's tweet "wasn't the 'witness intimidation' voters care about," writes Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post. " Keen to undermine House Republicans' entire impeachment strategy, President Trump took to Twitter to attack Marie Yovanovitch for not single-handedly saving Somalia, a failed state in its third decade of civil war, and Ukraine, from which he expunged her. Crucially, he did this as Yovanovitch was publicly testifying to the House Intelligence Committee as a part of the impeachment proceedings.
– Virginia's state Senate has passed a "red flag" bill that would allow police to temporarily seize people's guns if they're deemed a threat, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. The bill passed by a party-line vote of 21-19 with every Democrat in favor and every Republican against. Debate on the bill got "unusually sharp" as some GOP senators suggested that the bill would violate the Second Amendment's right to bear arms. The Virginia Shooting Sports Association reports the bill is like similar legislation throughout the country, in that it allows court orders to be issued to prevent certain people from buying or possessing guns. The Virginia Mercury reports the Red Flag legislation is like similar legislation throughout the country, in that it allows court orders to be issued to prevent certain people from buying or possessing guns.

In a statement, Coats said he was "shocked and surprised" by the invitation, the Hill reports. "Director Coats has been briefed on the meeting between President Trump and President Putin," the White House said. "President Trump has asked President Putin to visit the United States in the fall."
– The fate of hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the US illegally as children will be decided by the Supreme Court on Tuesday. The justices will hear arguments in three cases related to President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which was put in place by President Obama in 2012 to protect immigrants who came to the US illegally as children. Trump tried to end the program as soon as he took office, but lower courts blocked his move, and now legal challenges to his decision are making their way to the Supreme Court. Here's what you need to know: What's at stake: If the court rules in favor of Trump's decision to end DACA, hundreds of thousands of young immigrants—known as "Dreamers"—will no longer be protected from deportation and could find themselves at risk of being deported, the New York Times reports. If the court rules against Trump, it could open the door for lower courts to re-impose the program. What's at stake: If the court rules against Trump, it could open the door to legal challenges to the program from other parts of the country, including states that have made it harder for Dreamers to obtain work permits. What's at stake: If the court rules against Trump, it could open the door to legal challenges to the program from other parts of the country, including states that have made it harder for Dreamers to obtain work permits. What's at stake: If the court ruling against Trump, it could open the possibility that the program could be overturned, and the fate of hundreds of Dreamers who could be forced to apply for jobs and get an opportunity to find jobs. The New York City's open, which has been open.
– The US will get 100 million more doses of the coronavirus vaccine after a $1.95 billion deal with Pfizer and its partner, BioNTech, was announced Wednesday by the Department of Health and Human Services. The deal doubles the 200 million doses the US has ordered so far, and also includes the option to buy an additional 400 million doses. "With these 100 million additional doses, the United States will be able to protect more individuals and hopefully end this devastating pandemic more quickly," Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement, per CNBC. The deal will allow millions more Americans to be vaccinated at zero cost by next fall.
– The Trump administration has extended a freeze on student loan payments for another four years, the New York Times reports. The pause, put in place by Congress last year as part of the CARES Act, had been set to expire at the end of September, but the Education Department announced Friday that it would be extended until Jan. 31, 2022. "The payment pause has been a lifeline that allowed millions of Americans to focus on their families, health, and finances instead of student loans during the national emergency," Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement. The extension will allow the department to transition borrowers back into repayment and reduce the risk of default and delinquency, the Washington Post reports.
– President Trump began his two-day visit to India on Monday with a stop at the Taj Mahal, where he was joined by first lady Melania Trump for a tour of the site, the Washington Post reports. "I've never been to the Taj Mahal, but I've heard it's incredible," Trump told reporters on Air Force One. "I'm looking forward to seeing it." The president is scheduled to visit New Delhi on Tuesday. Here's what else you need to know about Trump's visit to India: Trump's motorcade made its way through the streets of New Delhi, where police used tear gas to break up protests against a new law that makes it easier to become a citizen of the country, the BBC reports. Hundreds of people were protesting the law in the northeast city of Maujpur on Sunday when police fired tear gas to disperse them. The Wall Street Journal has a fact-check on seven of Trump's statements about India, including: "Since the turn of the century, the size of the Indian economy has grown over six times in size." Reality check: Trump is correct.
– The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination Thursday afternoon, but two Republican senators are calling for a delay. Sen. Jeff Flake and Sen. Bob Corker, who are retiring at the end of this term, say the hearing of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accuses Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, should be delayed until after the committee hears from Ford, the Hill reports. Democrats have called for a delay in the vote.
– "He won because the Election was Rigged," President Trump tweeted Sunday morning, but he later clarified that he wasn't conceding the election. "He won because the Election was Rigged," the president wrote, before falsely claiming that no observers or watchers had been allowed. "He won because the Election was Rigged," wrote Trump, who has repeatedly claimed to have won the election, even after every major news organization projected Joe Biden as the winner. The Guardian notes that Trump's tweet "set off a flurry of misleading reports suggesting he had finally admitted that he lost his bid for reelection." "Trump says Biden won," CNN said. "Trump says Biden won," BBC News announced. "Referring to Mr. Biden, the president said that 'he won,'" the New York Times said. "Trump seems to suggest Biden 'won' but later says he's not conceding."
– "In a break with convention, the editorial board has chosen to endorse two separate Democratic candidates for president," reads the New York Times' endorsement of Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. It's the paper's first-ever endorsement of two candidates, notes the Hill, and it comes just two weeks before the first votes in the Democratic primary, in Iowa and New Hampshire. Warren and Klobuchar were the only two candidates the Times interviewed for its endorsement, which came after a month-long process that included interviews with nine candidates and the making of the Weekly Standard's documentary show The Weekly: The New York Times Presidential Election Special.
– A DNA test has confirmed that Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, is the father of a baby born in Arkansas last year, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. A motion filed Wednesday in Independence County on behalf of the baby's mother, Lunden Alexis Roberts, states that the test "has established, with scientific certainty, that Hunter Biden is the father of an Arkansas baby." The motion states that Biden "is not expected to challenge the results of the DNA test or the testing process." The filing states that Biden, who has denied fathering the child, "verbally admitted" to Roberts in private that he was the father of the child.
– President Trump signed the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act into law on Wednesday—and China isn't happy about it. The bill, which passed the US Congress with only a single "no" vote, was signed without a public event and is intended to send China a "strong message on human rights by mandating sanctions against those responsible for the oppression of members of China's Muslim minority," the White House said in a statement, per Reuters. The act was signed less than an hour after excerpts from a book by former National Security Adviser John Bolton were published, in which Bolton claims Trump told Chinese President Xi Jinping he approved of "concentration camps" used to detain thousands of Uighurs in western China, the New York Times reports. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that the act "severely infringed on China's sovereignty, security, and people's rights." The Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act "severely infringes on China's sovereignty, security, and people's rights," the ministry said, adding that the act "severely damages China's political, economic, and social rights and infringes on its citizens' rights." The White House said Trump signed the act "without a public event."
– As a candidate, Joe Biden said he would raise the cap on refugee admissions to the US to 60,000. As president, he's kept it at 15,000. On Friday, Biden signed an "emergency determination" to keep the cap at that level, a senior administration official tells Axios. The number of refugees allowed into the US this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, is currently the lowest ever accepted by any president. Former President Trump had set the cap at 15,000.
– The FDA is tightening up requirements for emergency authorization of any new coronavirus vaccine, reports the New York Times, adding "a new layer of caution to the vetting process even as President Trump continues to contradict his own scientific experts and promise that a vaccine will be available as early as next month." The new guidelines, which the FDA is expected to release in the next week or two, will make it more difficult for the agency to green-light a vaccine that hasn't been proven to work against the deadly virus. "That sounds like a political move," said President Trump during a White House press briefing Wednesday, per the Hill. "We may or may not approve it." The new guidelines will make it more difficult for the FDA to approve a vaccine that hasn't been proven to work against coronavirus, which has killed more than 700 people in the past two years. The new guidelines will also make it more difficult for the FDA to approve a vaccine that hasn't been proven to work against the virus. The new guidelines will also make it more difficult for the FDA to approve a vaccine that hasn't been proven to work against coronavirus. The new guidelines will also make it more difficult for the FDA to approve a vaccine that hasn't been proven to work against the virus.
– When Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin meet in Geneva tomorrow, they'll be sitting next to each other in an 18th-century villa on the shores of Lake Geneva. It's a safe bet that Putin will be wearing a suit, and he'll be looking to impress the US vice president, who has called the Russian leader a "killer" and said he "doesn't have a soul," reports the New York Times. What to watch for when the two leaders sit down for their first face-to-face meeting: Biden wants a "more stable and predictable" relationship with Russia, while Putin wants to show that his country is taken seriously as a world power, says Fiona Hill of the Brookings Institution. "Russia is quite invested in having a very friction-filled rather than friction-free relationship with the United States," she says. What Biden might bring to the table: arms control, climate change, human rights, and the fight against ISIS, notes the Times. What Putin might bring to the table: allegations that Russia interfered in the US election, reports the Wall Street Journal.
– The US economy is doing "tremendously well," President Trump said Sunday as he left the White House after a vacation in Bedminster, NJ. "I don't see a recession," he said, per the Guardian. "I'm prepared for everything. I don't think we're having a recession." Trump's comments echoed those of his top economic advisers, who last week said there was "no recession in sight."
– A White House official says President Trump's July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine was "inappropriate" and "ill-advised," Politico reports. Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council's top Ukraine expert, testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. He said Trump's call to Viktor Yanukovich was "inappropriate and ill-advised" because Yanukovich had just been elected and was considering investigating Trump's political rivals. Vindman said Trump's call was also "inappropriate" because it encouraged Yanukovich to open an investigation into Trump and his associates. He said the call was also "inappropriate" because it came from the president's personal account. Vindman was one of two White House aides who listened to Trump's call with Yanukovich. The other was Jennifer Williams, Vice President Mike Pence's deputy chief of staff for communications, who said she had concerns about the call, the Hill reports. Vindman and Williams will both testify before the House Judiciary Committee, which is investigating whether Trump obstructed justice when he fired FBI Director James Comey. Democrats have called nine witnesses for this week's impeachment hearings.
– The Supreme Court ruled unanimously Monday that immigrants who entered the US illegally but were later allowed to stay for humanitarian reasons are not eligible to become permanent residents. The decision could affect thousands of people, including many who have lived in the US for years and hoped to obtain lawful permanent resident status, or a green card, the New York Times reports. Justice Elena Kagan wrote that the court agreed with a circuit court decision that illegal immigrants with temporary protected status are not eligible for green cards, which allow them to remain in the country indefinitely. The ruling means that immigrants with TPS may remain in the country but cannot establish residency. TPS is a designation the federal government extends to countries wracked by war or natural disaster. The case, Sanchez v. Mayorkas, could affect tens of thousands of immigrants. It was brought by Jose Sanchez and Sonia Gonzalez, natives of El Salvador who entered the US unlawfully in the late 1990s. In 2001, after earthquakes devastated El Salvador, the United States made that country's nationals eligible for the "temporary protected status" program. TPS is a designation the federal government extends to countries wracked by war or natural disaster. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously on Monday that immigrants allowed to stay in the United States temporarily for humanitarian reasons may not apply for green cards if they had entered the country unlawfully.
– Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld says he's challenging President Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. "I really think if we have six more years of the same stuff we've had out of the White House the last two years, that would be a political tragedy and I would fear for the republic," the 73-year-old tells CNN. Weld, who served two terms as governor, is the first Republican so far to declare his candidacy, the AP reports. He tells MSNBC that he wants to "put the president to his proofs" and challenge his positions. "You ask him some questions, like, why do you think it's good to insult our military allies, why do you praise dictators?" he says. "Is it because you wish the United States was more dictatorial? I'm afraid that might be the case."
– It's that time of year again: time for journalists to reflect on their work in 2017 and weigh in on the big stories of the year. Here's a look at some of the top stories of the year, via the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, and the Washington Post: Stormy Daniels: The former White House press secretary has emerged as a central figure in President Trump's attacks on the media. She's been called everything from a "coward" to a "moron" to a "sleazy guttersnipe." She's been interviewed by the New York Times, the New York Daily News, the Washington Post, and CNN, among others. She's been called everything from a "coward" to a "moron" to a "sleazy guttersnipe."

He's been interviewed by the New York Times, the New York Post, and CNN, among others. He's been called everything from a "moron" to a "sleazy guttersnipe" in Trump's attacks on the media.
– The Trump administration reported a river of red ink Friday. The federal deficit for the 2019 budget year surged 26% from 2018 to $984.4 billion—its highest point in seven years, reports the AP. The gap is widely expected to top $1 trillion in the current budget year and likely remain there for the next decade. The year-over-year widening in the deficit reflected such factors as revenue lost from the 2017 Trump tax cut and a budget deal that added billions in spending for military and domestic programs. The deficit has exploded over the past year despite substantial economic growth. GOP tax cuts in 2017, combined with increased discretionary spending and a failure to rein in entitlement programs, have contributed to the increase.
– "I happen to be taking it," President Trump said Monday during a roundtable discussion with restaurant executives at the White House. "I hope to not be able to take it soon, you know, because I hope that they come up with some answer. But I think people should be allowed to." Trump said he's been taking hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that he's repeatedly touted as a treatment for coronavirus, despite warnings from the FDA, the Hill reports. "A lot of good things have come out. And you'd be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the front-line workers, before you catch it," Trump said. "The front-line workers—many, many are taking it."
– Sen. Jeff Flake says he won't vote for any more of President Trump's judicial nominees until the Senate votes on a bill to protect Robert Mueller from being fired as special counsel, the Hill reports. The Arizona Republican says he won't support any of Trump's picks for the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit until the bipartisan bill protecting Mueller is voted on. Flake says he's "appalled" by Trump's firing of James Comey and wants the Senate to pass the bipartisan bill before Trump leaves office. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has blocked any further nominations until the bill is voted on, CNN reports.
– Visitors to the New York Times, CNN, Amazon, Spotify, Al Jazeera Media Network, and other major websites were having a hard time today. The websites were down for about an hour this morning, according to Downdetector.com, which noted that Reddit, Amazon, Paypal, Spotify, and the New York Times were also having problems. The problem appears to have been caused by a glitch at Fastly, a San Francisco-based cloud computing services provider, the Wall Street Journal reports.
– President Trump's approval rating has sunk to an all-time low, according to the latest Washington Post/ABC News poll. The poll found that 38% of respondents approve of the job Trump is doing as president, compared to 60% who disapprove. That's the lowest rating Trump has received in the Post/ABC poll's history, and comes on the heels of a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll that found he trailed Joe Biden by 11 points. Trump's approval rating among "haters" is also at an all-time low, the poll found, with just 38% approving of his handling of the coronavirus, compared to 60% who disapproved. The poll also found that a majority of Americans don't trust Trump to make the right decisions when it comes to the economy, the New York Times reports. The Post/ABC poll surveyed 1,002 adults between Sept. 26-30, the same time period during which the Trump administration announced new tariffs.
– Hundreds of people were arrested in Mississippi this week in what federal officials are calling the largest single-state raid in US history, the Clarion-Ledger reports. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents raided seven food processing plants Wednesday, arresting 680 people believed to be illegal aliens. It's the largest workplace raid in the last 11 years, according to the Washington Post. The raids were conducted by Homeland Security Investigations "at seven agricultural processing plants across Mississippi," ICE said in a statement.
– Joe Biden has chosen former President Obama's chief of staff Denis McDonough to be his secretary of Veterans Affairs, the New York Times reports. McDonough, who served as national security adviser and UN ambassador under Obama, will be the fourth member of Biden's incoming administration to have served in the White House. The Times notes that the move "marks a surprising shift for Rice, a longtime Democratic foreign policy expert who served as President Obama's national security adviser and UN ambassador." The AP reports that Biden has also named Susan Rice as director of the White House Domestic Policy Council. Rice served as national security adviser for Obama from 2013 to 2017.
– President Trump is expected to sign a bill to keep the government open and fund his proposed border wall, Politico reports. The bill, which includes $1.38 billion for 55 miles of physical barriers, falls short of Trump's demands for more than $5 billion for a wall. According to the AP, the White House had asked for more than $5 billion for border security, including walls and other barriers. Trump said Wednesday that Democrats are "stingy" with money for a border wall, but he has "other options" to pay for it and wants to avoid another government shutdown.
– President Trump and Vladimir Putin have wrapped up their one-on-one meeting without much in the way of progress on the allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 US election. The big headline-maker afterward was Trump's apparent acceptance of Putin's denial during a joint press conference. Here's a look at coverage: The big question: Will Trump push Putin to extradite the 12 Russian intelligence officers accused of tampering with the election? The Washington Post looks at the "elephant in the room" of Trump-Putin relations and asks the big question: "Will Trump push Putin to extradite the 12 Russians charged with tampering with the 2016 US election?" The AP looks at the "elephant in the room" of Trump-Putin relations and asks the big question: "Will Trump push Putin to extradite the 12 Russians charged with tampering with the 2016 US election?" CNN looks at the "elephant in the room" of Trump-Putin relations and asks the big question: "Will Trump push Putin to extradite the 12 Russians charged with tampering with the 2016 US election?" The Wall Street Journal looks at the "elephant in the room" of Trump-Putin relations and asks the big question: "Will Trump push Putin to extradite the 12 Russians charged with tampering with the 2016 US election?" CNN looks at the "elephant in the room" of Trump-Putin relations and asks the big question: "Will Trump push Putin to extradite the 12 Russians?" The New York Times looks at the "elephant in the room" and asks the big question: "Will Trump push Putin and if he will be able to convince the Russians to extradite or if he will be able to convince the US to prove the Russians to prove the allegations that he can prove that they can prove that they can prove anything.” The Wall Street looks at the fact that the two would be the two would be a major problem.
– By mid-April, 90% of US adults will be able to get the swine flu vaccine, according to Joe Biden. The vice president, who has set a goal of 200 million vaccine shots in his first 100 days in office, says the goal is "a stunning example that there is nothing this country cannot do if we put our minds to it, and we do it together," the Wall Street Journal reports. "But our work is far from over," he says. The CDC says there have been more than 5,600 cases of swine flu in the US so far this year, including 18 deaths, the New York Times reports.
– The number of Americans filing first-time jobless claims dropped by 1,500 last week, to 1.897 million, the Labor Department announced today. Economists had expected claims to hold steady at 1.565 million, the Wall Street Journal reports. The number of people receiving unemployment benefits, however, ticked down slightly to 20,929,000, the AP reports. The four-week average, which smooths out week-to-week volatility, fell to 2,170,250—its lowest level since January. The AP notes that the Cypher 2 computer game was released just ahead of today's report.
– Facebook has banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for 30 days for "hate speech" and "encouraging physical harm," reports the Guardian. Jones, who hosts the Infowars radio show and is a prominent supporter of President Trump, has been accused by social media platforms of encouraging violence in videos he posted. YouTube, meanwhile, has removed four of his videos, reports the New York Times.
– Leslie Moonves is out as chairman and CEO of CBS following a bombshell New Yorker report that accuses him of sexual misconduct and the network of keeping a lid on the allegations for 20 years. The report cited accounts from six women who say Moonves sexually assaulted them and from another woman who says he forced her to perform oral sex. The New Yorker said at least four of the women came forward to say Moonves forced them to perform sexual acts. The report also said CBS hadn't paid any of the women who accused Moonves of misconduct. Moonves denies the allegations. "I have never used my position to hinder the advancement of women," Moonves said in a statement. "I have never used my power to harm the reputations of women." He said the allegations against him are "entirely false." CBS said that while Moonves' departure is effective immediately, his financial package will be withheld pending an investigation.
– US employers posted a record-high number of job openings for the second straight month, spotlighting persistent hiring challenges as a snapback in economic activity generates high demand for workers. The number of available positions on the last day of May rose slightly to 9.21 million, the US Department of Labor's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed on Wednesday. That's the highest since records began in December 2000. The Wall Street Journal notes that job openings are about 30% higher than they were in February 2020, right before the flu pandemic hit. The number of people quitting their jobs slipped in May from a record high in April, but remains elevated.
– North Korea has launched two suspected short-range missiles, South Korea's military says—the second such launch in less than a week, CNN reports. The missiles were fired Thursday from the North's Sino-ri missile base, which is around 130 miles north of the border with South Korea. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff say the missiles traveled around 260 miles before falling into the Sea of Japan off the coast of North Korea's east coast. Thursday's launch follows North Korea's test of an ICBM on Saturday, which the US responded to with its own ICBM test 10 minutes later.
– First lady Melania Trump's "Be Best" campaign has come under fire for borrowing heavily from a document published by the Federal Trade Commission under former President Obama, the Hill reports. The "Be Best" campaign uses the FTC's "Parent and Child Online Safety" pamphlet, which was released in 2014. The first lady's office calls the accusations "opposition media" and accuses the media of distorting the facts.
– The Supreme Court on Thursday blocked the Trump administration's attempt to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which protected hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the US illegally as children. The 5-4 ruling was written by Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor. The court's decision, 5-4, allows the Obama-era program to stay in place following the Trump administration's attempt to disassemble it in September 2017.
– "When somebody is president of the United States, the authority is total," President Trump said at a press conference Monday when asked about the decision by governors in the Northeast and West to allow schools and businesses to reopen after the end of the coronavirus outbreak. "The president of the United States calls the shots," Trump said, though the US Constitution says states have "total authority" to keep public order and safety under control, the Independent reports. Trump's claim is "frightening," according to the Sydney Morning Herald, which notes that other presidents—including FDR, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama—have been caught short in similar situations.
– The second summit between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ended abruptly Thursday afternoon after talks broke down over two big sticking points, CNN reports. According to CBS News, Trump said Kim wanted sanctions lifted "in their entirety" without committing to getting rid of his country's nuclear arsenal. "I am always prepared to walk," Trump said. Trump said the two sides had made progress in talks that had focused on denuclearization, but it was important not to "rush into a bad deal."
– Students in at least 1,000 schools across 35 states have been forced to stay home from class because of a common cold virus, Fox News reports. According to data from New York-based data service Burbio, the cold—or COVID-19—has forced schools to close for anywhere from one day to several weeks. Most have moved to remote learning, delayed the start of school, or shifted to hybrid learning, Burbio reports. According to AL.com, Alabama schools have reported 13,000 cases of COVID-19 since the start of the school year. "Having children in the classroom is critically important to learning," Dr. Patrice Harris, former president of the American Medical Association, tells Fox. "Keeping schools open is a particular challenge now as we have seen an increasing number of children with moderate illness and hospitalized with COVID-19."
– Joe Biden's transition team has said the former vice president will always "listen to science," but Bay Area health experts say there's a chance his victory celebrations over the weekend could have contributed to the spread of the deadly coronavirus. The Los Angeles Times reports that Bay Area epidemiologists say they're "extremely concerned" the celebrations for Biden, as well as for California Attorney General Kamala Harris, could have contributed to the spread of the virus, which experts say is especially dangerous for children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people stay away from celebrations that could contribute to the spread of the virus.
– The Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules Monday, meaning Internet service providers such as Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T no longer have to treat all web traffic equally. The move is designed to make it easier for Internet companies to charge more for faster delivery of their content, reports the Wall Street Journal. "Today is a dark day for all who use the internet," FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement. "No one should be forced to pay more for faster delivery of their content." Critics of the move say it will make the internet less open and competitive. Here's what else you need to know: The AP explains the "Rethinking the Internet" section of the FCC's Open Internet Order, which was approved by a vote of 3-2 in December. It reverses rules put in place in 2015 to ensure Internet service providers couldn't block or slow down content or charge more for faster delivery of it.
– President Trump handed out "fake news" awards to six news organizations Wednesday night—and the New York Times came out on top. The president tweeted out a list of the top 10 stories of the year "covered by the Fake News Media," and the Times came out on top with five of those stories, the Hill reports. Other winners were CNN (three), NBC (two), Fox News (one), and the Washington Post (one). "Congratulations to the New York Times, which I love very much, on winning the big 'Fake News Award,'" Trump tweeted. "Congratulations to CNN, which I love very much, on winning the big 'Fake News Award,'" he added. "Congratulations to Fox News, which I love very much, on winning the big 'Fake News Award,'" he added. "And of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course."
– South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford, a frequent critic of President Trump, has been defeated in his Republican primary after Trump tweeted his support for opponent Katie Arrington, CNN reports. "Thank you @realDonaldTrump for giving me the support I needed," Sanford tweeted after the result was announced. "I will continue to fight for you in Congress until my term is up." Sanford, who left the House in 2009 to travel the world as an Appalachian Trail hiker, had been leading the race to replace retiring Rep. Trey Gowdy, but he faced a strong challenge from Arrington, a political newcomer who had the support of the state's GOP establishment, including the state's GOP chairman. "The people of South Carolina have a right to know who they're voting for in November," Arrington said after the result was announced. "And they're going to know that I'm not going to be a Trump critic." Trump tweeted his support for Arrington hours before the result was announced, saying Sanford "has been unhelpful to our Country" and "has been weak on the Border, Crime, Military, Judges, Military, Supreme Court, and so many other aspects of our Country." He added: "Katie Arrington will be a great Supreme Court Justice, very tough on crime, very tough on illegal immigration, very tough on ISIS, very tough on gangs, very tough on crime in South Carolina. Vote for Katie Arrington!"
– Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Wednesday, ending one of the most dramatic political transitions in American history. "Democracy has prevailed," he said after taking the oath of office from Chief Justice John Roberts. Outgoing President Donald Trump, who has not formally conceded, is not attending the ceremony. Biden took the oath at a US Capitol that had been battered by an insurrectionist siege just two weeks earlier. On a cold Washington morning dotted with snow flurries, the quadrennial ceremony unfolded within a circle of security forces evocative of a war zone and devoid of crowds because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Washington Post reports.
– After 21 years at the helm, Larry Page is stepping down as CEO of Google's parent company, Alphabet, and will be replaced by Sundar Pichai, the company's current CEO. Sergey Brin, who served as president of Alphabet, will remain on the board of directors, the Wall Street Journal reports. "While it has been a tremendous privilege to be deeply involved in the day-to-day management of the company for so long, we believe it's time to assume the role of proud parents—offer advice and love, but not daily nagging!" the company said in a blog post. " Sundar Pichai just got the worst job in Silicon Valley," Mashable quips. "Congrats to Sundar Pichai, who just got promoted to the worst job in Silicon Valley."
– Scientists around the world are working on a vaccine for a new virus that has killed dozens of people and sickened hundreds more, but the process is likely to take at least a year, Wired reports. Researchers are working on a vaccine for coronavirus, which is related to the H5N1 strain of bird flu. "I think there's a high chance that it will work based on other things that we have done with this type of vaccine," the lead researcher tells the Times of London. "It's not just a hunch and as every week goes by we have more data to look at, I would go for 80%, that's my personal view."
– "We're ready for a presidency that will restore respect for our Constitution and bring people together." Those are the words of Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, who on Tuesday launched an exploratory committee for the Libertarian Party's nomination for president of the United States, reports the Detroit Free Press. The 48-year-old, who left the Republican Party earlier this month, says he's running because "Americans are ready for practical approaches based in humility and trust of the people." Amash, who was first elected to the House in 2010 and served as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, says he wants to restore "respect for our Constitution and bring people together." He says he's also running because of President Trump's "divisiveness, recklessness, incompetence, and record-breaking unpopularity." Amash's entry into the race could have a "very significant moment" in the 2020 race, notes the Los Angeles Times, but it's not clear how he'll raise the funds to run.
– "I would love to give them, but I'm not going to do it while I'm under audit." That's President Trump's take on the deadline for him to turn over his tax returns to House Democrats, who had demanded them as part of their probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. "I would love to give them, but I'm not going to do it while I'm under audit," Trump told reporters as he departed the White House for a trip to Texas, per the Washington Post. The New York Times notes that Trump has previously said he would "love" to hand over the returns, "but I'm not going to do it while I'm under audit." House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal had demanded six years of Trump's personal and business tax returns, including information on eight of his business entities, as well as the identities of anyone who may have colluded with the Russians. The White House has rejected Neal's request.
– "We can continue to combat sexual misconduct without abandoning our core values of fairness, presumption of innocence, and due process," Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said Wednesday as she issued new rules related to sexual misconduct in schools. The more than 2,000-page rule, which has been in the works for more than a year, includes changes to Title IX, the 1972 law that prohibits "discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance," the Washington Post reports. Under the new rules, schools will be required to allow cross-examination of students accused of sexual misconduct in a live hearing and will be required to provide a "reasonable opportunity" for the accused student to cross-examine his or her accuser, USA Today reports. DeVos says the new rules will "balance the scales of justice on campuses across America." The Department of Education says the new rules will "help ensure that all students accused of sexual misconduct are treated with the same presumption of innocence and due process." The department believes the new rules will "balance the scales of justice on campuses across America," a Department of Education spokesperson said during Wednesday's press briefing.
– House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has introduced legislation to create a select committee to investigate the attack on the US Capitol on Jan. 6. The committee would have 13 members, five of whom would be appointed by Pelosi "after consultation with the minority leader," the Wall Street Journal reports. The move comes after Senate Republicans blocked the formation of an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate the attack, in which hundreds of former President Trump's supporters violently broke into the Capitol and interrupted the certification of President Joe Biden's victory. The House is expected to vote on the bill this week. In a twist, Pelosi is "seriously considering" appointing a Republican to the body, which would give the committee closer to even-partisan representation while still allowing Democrats more power than they would have had in the failed Jan. 6 commission.
– It's the last day to vote in the midterm elections, but voters in 11 states will also be choosing their next governor. In those 11 states, nine incumbent governors are seeking re-election and one is leaving the seat open to run for the US Senate. Here are the races to watch:
– "America is back, the trans-Atlantic alliance is back," the New York Times quotes Joe Biden as saying in a speech at the Munich Security Conference on Friday. "We are not looking backward." The former vice president was speaking in support of the trans-Atlantic alliance, which he called "the foundation of our security, our prosperity, and our way of life," the Guardian reports. Biden also spoke out against climate change, warning that "democratic progress is under assault" in the US and Europe. Biden's speech was an attempt to burnish his reputation as a defender of "America First" diplomacy, in which the US went it alone, the Times reports. Biden also spoke at the G-7 summit, where he told leaders that the days of "America First" diplomacy under President Trump are over.
– Kellyanne Conway will be leaving the White House at the end of the month, she announced in a letter sent to President Trump Sunday night. "I have decided to leave the @WhiteHouse at the end of this month so that I can spend more time with my four teenage children," she wrote. "This is completely my choice and my voice." The Wall Street Journal reports that Conway informed Trump of her decision in the Oval Office. Conway's husband, conservative lawyer George Conway, also announced on social media that he would be stepping back from his position at the Lincoln Project, an organization comprised of anti-Trump Republicans and independents.
– The US will be sending 20 million doses of coronavirus vaccine to help fight the disease around the world, President Biden announced today. It's the first time the US will give away doses that could be used here, the New York Times reports. Most of the doses will go to AstraZeneca, which has no authorization for use in the US. "We need to help fight the disease around the world," Biden said. "The United States will share at least 20 million of those doses, that extra supply with other countries."
– The House of Representatives is set to vote tomorrow on two immigration bills—one that would provide a path to citizenship for so-called "Dreamers," younger immigrants brought to the US illegally as children, and one that would provide legal status to farm workers. The bills are part of an effort by Democrats to show they're serious about immigration reform while President Obama and Republicans continue to try to hammer out a comprehensive plan, reports the Hill. The Dream and Promise Act would provide a path to citizenship for immigrants brought here illegally as children, while the Farm Modernization Workforce Act would make it easier for farm workers to apply for work visas. The bills "could serve as the first barometer of the chances for comprehensive immigration reform in this session of Congress," notes the Hill.
– Pandemic H1N1 has created a labor shortage so severe that some shipping workers are calling for a “global transport systems collapse,” the Telegraph reports. Seafarers, truck drivers, and airline workers have endured quarantines, travel restrictions, and complex Covid-19 vaccination and testing requirements to keep global supply chains moving. But many are now reaching their breaking point, posing yet another threat to the badly tangled network of ports, container vessels, and trucking companies that moves goods around the world. In an open letter, the World Road Transport Organization, the International Air Transport Association, the International Chamber of Shipping, and the International Transport Workers’ Federation said their members have been “failed by governments and taken for granted by their officials” during the pandemic.
– A new NPR/Marist poll has some worrying news for Republicans: In a troubling sign for Republicans less than two months before November's elections, Democrats' advantage on the question of which party Americans are more likely to vote for in November is ballooning, according to the poll. The percentage of Republicans who say they'll vote for a Democrat in November has jumped 10 points in the past two months, while the percentage of Republicans who say they'll vote for a Republican has dropped 4 points. Democrats are even more likely to say they'll vote for a Republican in November than they were two months ago. The poll also found that a majority of independent voters say they'll vote for a Democrat in November, the first time that's happened in the history of the NPR/Marist poll. Republicans, however, are still favored to keep control of the House.
– President Trump's decision to pull out of a 2015 agreement over Iran's nuclear program is now official: Iran says it has violated the terms of the deal. The country's state-run IRNA news agency said Sunday that the enrichment of uranium above the limits set in the deal would begin within hours, the AP reports. The news agency said the next step in Iran's compliance with the deal would be taken in 60 days. It was the second time in a week that Iran had violated the limits set in the deal, which Trump pulled out of last year. Iran had warned that it would ramp up nuclear activities in a bid to raise the pressure on Europe, China, and Russia to provide relief from crippling US economic sanctions. Since Trump pulled out of the pact last year, Tehran has warned it would step up nuclear activities in a bid to raise the pressure on Europe, China, and Russia to provide relief from crippling US economic sanctions. Iran said on Sunday that within hours it would breach the limits on uranium enrichment set four years ago in an accord with the United States and other international powers that was designed to keep Tehran from producing a nuclear weapon. The latest move inches Iran closer to where it was before the accord: on the path to being able to produce an atomic bomb. The latest move inches Iran closer to where it was before the accord: on the path to being able to produce an atomic bomb.
– President Trump's second impeachment trial is over. The Senate on Saturday voted 57-43 to acquit him of the charge of inciting an insurrection, which came after the House voted to impeach him last month. Seven Republicans joined Democrats in voting to convict, but the two-thirds majority needed to convict in the Senate was not there, reports the Hill. The seven GOP senators to vote against Trump were Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.
– The Biden administration is expected to ask dozens of Trump-appointed US attorneys to resign—but not all of them. A senior Justice Department official tells Fox News that Delaware US Attorney David Weiss, who is leading the tax investigation into Joe Biden's son Hunter, will remain in his post. It's standard procedure for new presidents to ask for the resignation of all US attorneys once they take office, and the Justice Department is expected to ask dozens of Trump-appointed US attorneys to resign from their posts as soon as Tuesday, the Washington Post reports.
– New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo today declared a state of emergency as the number of cases of coronavirus, a respiratory illness related to the common cold, swelled to more than 1,000 in the state, the New York Times reports. "I want to be able to say to the people of New York—I did everything we could do," Cuomo said. "And if everything we do saves just one life, I’ll be happy." The lockdown will go into effect at 8pm Sunday, shutting down non-essential businesses and public transportation, the New York Daily News reports. In California, meanwhile, Gov. Gavin Newsom today declared a state of emergency as the death toll from the illness rose to 20, Reuters reports.
– President Trump's travel ban has expanded to six more countries. The White House announced Friday that citizens of Burma, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania will no longer be able to visit the US if they have a visa from one of those countries, the AP reports. Officials say the new restrictions are the result of failures by the countries to meet US security and information-sharing standards. Previously, the US allowed travelers from seven countries—Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen—to visit the US if they had a visa from one of those countries.
– President Trump called for an "angry majority" during a rally in Mississippi on Tuesday—a call that may have helped Republican incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin pull out a narrow win in Kentucky's closely contested governor's race, NBC News reports. With 62% of precincts reporting, Bevin was leading Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear, 49.4% (456,332 votes) to 48.5% (448,018 votes). But the race is too close to call, and it's one of three states with off-year elections Tuesday that will test Trump's ability to motivate Republican voters in the midst of the impeachment inquiry and Democrats' chances of capitalizing on his unpopularity ahead of next year's presidential election. In other races:
– Hong Kong police clashed with pro-democracy protesters at the city's main airport terminal on Tuesday, leaving at least one person injured, the AP reports. Video showed officers attempting to clear out the crowd at Hong Kong International Airport as the protesters chanted. Not long after the intense altercation began, most of the protesters had left the airport and police had pulled back. Several demonstrators were arrested during the violent confrontation.

"He should really stop insulting people." Powell, who served under President George W. Bush and was secretary of state under George W. Bush, said Trump is trying to destroy "what's kept us alive," the Guardian reports. "I don't know if he can be a moral leader, because right now that is not the way he is acting," Powell said, adding that Trump has become "me the president" instead of "we the people."
– President Trump opened his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Friday by attacking "predatory" trade practices and warning that the US will not tolerate unfair trade practices, the AP reports.

– Is it safe to send your kids to school? A new study out of Duke University and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill finds that in-school transmission of the common cold-like virus known as coronavirus is "extremely rare," reports Medical News Today. Researchers looked at 11 school districts with nearly 100,000 staff and students, and found that there were just 32 cases of either kid-to-kid or adult-to-adult transmission during in-person instruction over a nine-week period. The study, published in the American Academy of Pediatrics journal Pediatrics, comes at a time when many countries are taking steps to curb the spread of the virus, including shutting down schools.

– President Trump's one-time campaign chairman is now the subject of a criminal investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, the New York Times reports. According to a court filing late Monday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein gave Mueller the authority to investigate Paul Manafort's work for the Ukrainian government, as well as possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. The filing states Mueller has the authority to investigate Manafort's work "and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation." The filing states Rosenstein specifically told Mueller to look into Manafort's lobbying for the Ukrainian government, as well as possible collusion with Russian government officials. Mueller was authorized to investigate Manafort by Rosenstein in August last year, the Washington Post reports.
– The push for impeachment of President Trump picked up another notch Tuesday with the support of the co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Rep. Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat, said in a statement that "Regrettably, the president's most recent actions and continued disrespect for the Constitution are forcing us down the road to impeachment," the Wall Street Journal reports. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, also voiced support for impeachment, saying in a statement that Trump's "actions and rhetoric have undermined the integrity of the government and raised serious questions about our nation's commitment to the rule of law," the Hill reports.

– As part of a wave of GOP-backed election bills introduced in states around the nation after former President Trump alleged fraud led to his 2020 election defeat, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed a massive overhaul of election laws, shortly after the Republican-controlled state legislature approved it. The bill enacts new limitations on mail-in voting, expands most voters' access to in-person early voting, and caps a months-long battle over voting in a battleground state, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. "With Senate bill 202, Georgia will take another step toward ensuring our elections are secure, accessible, and fair," Kemp told reporters Thursday evening. Democrats and voting rights groups say the law will disproportionately disenfranchise voters of color. It is part of a wave of GOP-backed election bills introduced in states around the nation after Trump alleged fraud led to his 2020 election defeat. Georgia lawmakers on Thursday gave final approval to legislation to impose sweeping new restrictions on voting access in the state that make it harder to vote by mail and give the state legislature more power over elections.

– A new study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that people who haven't received the swine flu vaccine are more than twice as likely to be reinfected with the virus than people who have. The CDC looked at nearly 250 patients in Kentucky who had tested positive for Covid-19 in 2020 and tested positive again between May and June 2021. The study, published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, examined hundreds of residents, finding that the unvaccinated individuals had 2.34 times greater odds of reinfection compared with fully vaccinated individuals. The CDC says the findings highlight the importance of vaccines in containing the pandemic.
– Adam Schiff's closing remarks on the third day of the Senate's impeachment trial didn't go over well with Republicans, but Democrats have a point. In a New York Times op-ed, the top Democrat on the panel argued that President Trump should be removed from office for multiple reasons, including his response to the Robert Mueller investigation. "The president has undermined the very foundation of our democracy," Schiff wrote. "He has undermined the very foundation of our criminal justice system, and he has undermined the very foundation of our system of checks and balances.

"We will either cut off or substantially reduce our aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras as they struggle to protect their people from the onslaught of Central American migrants heading to the United States," Trump tweeted Monday. "This has been going on for a long time and we will continue to do what is necessary to protect our country," he said. "Border security is our number one issue.

On Friday, Sessions vowed to fight bias at the Justice Department as some Republicans raise concerns about political prejudice among the ranks of the FBI.
– It looks like President Trump's Christmas wish to add $2,000 stimulus checks to a $2.3 trillion spending package will have to wait. The Washington Post reports House Republicans and Democrats on Thursday blocked requests from both parties to add the extra checks to the bill. The move came after Trump complained about the package Tuesday night in a video posted to Twitter. The stimulus checks are part of the bill to fund the government for the rest of the year, and Trump wanted them added to it as well. Democrats wanted to increase them from $600 to $2,000 per person as part of a coronavirus economic relief initiative. Trump's fellow Republicans, who oppose the higher amount, blocked that effort.

– The White House told Congress on Friday that President Trump authorized the drone strike that killed Iran's most important general last month, contradicting the president's claim that he acted in response to an imminent threat. In a legally mandated, two-page unclassified memo to lawmakers, the White House asserted that the strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani was "in response to an escalating series of attacks in preceding months" by Iran and Iran-backed militias, the New York Times reports.

– Bump stocks, the devices that allowed Stephen Paddock's semiautomatic rifles to fire at nearly the speed of a fully automatic weapon, may be banned in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting. President Trump said Wednesday that he is willing to consider a ban on the devices, which were used by Paddock in his attack on the Route 91 Harvest music festival, the New York Times reports. "We're going to have to wait and see what happens," Trump said during a meeting with law enforcement officials at the White House. "We're going to have to wait and see what the Democrats do, and we're going to wait and see what the Republicans do." Democrats have called for a ban on the devices and on "bump stocks" in the wake of the shooting, which killed 58 people and injured more than 500. The devices were used in the Orlando nightclub shooting, the Charleston church shooting, and other mass shootings, but they have never been passed by Congress, the Washington Post reports.
– President Trump's endorsement didn't help Ron DeSantis' Florida gubernatorial bid Wednesday. Hours after the Republican lost the Democratic primary to Andrew Gillum, who's vying to become the state's first black governor, DeSantis told supporters not to "monkey this up" by voting for Gillum, who is black, the Miami Herald reports. "We're not going to monkey this up," DeSantis said. "We're going to get rid of the monkey in the room" by electing Gillum, who is hoping to become the state's first black governor, DeSantis said. His comments drew immediate condemnation, including from the Democratic National Committee, which called them "racist" and "reprehensible," the Washington Post reports. Gillum, who is vying to become the state's first black governor, defeated four other candidates in the five-way Democratic primary. Trump's endorsement didn't help DeSantis either, as the president tweeted his support for Gillum on Tuesday night. "DeSantis can't win in Florida if he can't beat Andrew Gillum," Trump wrote. "That's why I am endorsing Ron DeSantis for Governor of the Great State of Florida!"

– President Trump's admission that he'd accept dirt on his 2020 rivals from foreign governments is being called "despicable" by ethics experts and "an open invitation to foreign governments to commit crimes to re-elect Trump," the Wall Street Journal reports. In an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, Trump said, "It's not an interference, they have information—I think I'd take it." He added, "If I thought there was something wrong, I'd go maybe to the FBI—if I thought there was something wrong."

"He's a Christian, he's a conservative, he's built like a Republican, and he's done a great job for our country." The Washington Post reports Trump's endorsement is his "most explicit" so far in support of Moore.

– "To have a president of the United States suggesting, urging a foreign country to interfere in our presidential elections is an illustration that if this president has learned anything from the two years of [former special counsel Robert Mueller's] investigation, it's that he feels he can do anything with impunity," House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Thursday, calling President Trump's request for China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden "a fundamental breach of the president's oath of office." Trump tweeted Wednesday that Biden allowed his son, Hunter, to travel with him to China in 2013. The younger Biden was seeking Chinese investment for a new equity fund, and NBC News reports that there are "no indications Hunter met with Chinese government officials" during his father's official visit, though he did attend some formal events with his father.

– Senate Democrats say a Republican bill to reform the nation's police force is "half-assed" and "not salvageable," the Hill reports. The JUSTICE Act, introduced by South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, would ban chokeholds, improve hiring practices, and regulate "no-knock" warrants, among other things. But Democrats say it's "threadbare" and lacking in substance. "We will not meet this moment by holding a floor vote on the JUSTICE Act, nor can we simply amend this bill, which is so threadbare and lacking in substance that it does not even provide a proper baseline for negotiations," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sens. Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Bernie Sanders wrote to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday. Scott, who is the only black Republican in the Senate, says the bill "will make our police force more effective, safer, and more responsive to the American people," USA Today reports.

– The New Yorker has a lengthy profile of Christopher Steele, the man behind the infamous Trump-Russia dossier, and one line in particular is getting a lot of attention: "In late November 2016, Steele relayed information from his Russian sources that senior Kremlin officials had intervened to block Mitt Romney as President-elect Trump’s choice for secretary of State." The gist of the story is that Steele wrote the memo because he was worried that then-candidate Trump was about to fire FBI Director James Comey and replace him with someone who would be loyal to the Kremlin. The story makes clear that Steele didn't actually write the memo himself, but was commissioned by a foreign power to do so as part of an investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. The story also makes clear that Steele didn't pass the memo along to special counsel Robert Mueller's team, which is why it's getting so much attention. Read it in full here.

– For the first time in more than 60 years, Cuba is poised to have a government without a single Castro.

The 89-year-old Castro made the announcement Friday in a speech at the opening of the Eighth Congress of the ruling party, the only one allowed on the island. When Raul Castro announced three years ago that he would step down in 2021 as head of Cuba's all-powerful communist party, he surely envisioned the island on firmer economic footing and the transition to a new generation of leadership nearly complete. Things have not worked out exactly according to Castro's plan. As Castro announced, his country is deep in crisis. The tourism-dependent island has been battered by the pandemic; the economy shrunk at least 11% in 2020 according to government estimates.

"It played to Sundance and was watched by American people there; I met the public there and they really saw that the film is about a universal issue.
